Comparison of the 2 Pokemon searcher

The First Pokemon searcher uses plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, while the second pokemon searcher uses React.js

The vanilla JavaScript version directly manipulates the DOM using innerHTML, while the React version uses state (useState) to manage and update UI changes dynamically. In the vanilla version, the form listens for submissions, fetches Pok√©mon data from the API, and 
updates the page by modifying elements. The React version does the same but manages the data using state, making updates smoother and more efficient. It also uses JSX for rendering, allowing for cleaner and more modular code. Error handling in vanilla JavaScript is 
basic, often using console.log or alerts, while React uses state (setError) to display messages properly. Overall, the vanilla JS approach is simpler and good for small projects, but React is more scalable and efficient for larger applications.
